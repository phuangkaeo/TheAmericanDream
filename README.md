# TheAmericanDream
# Context of the project
You have only been doing data science for a month, but you are ambitious and already have your eyes on the future. This is the America you dream of. However, you know that the American dream is not as easily accessible as it used to be, you are going to need a plan! You have at your disposal two sets of data, it is up to you to build your career plan.

# What you need to achieve:

# ++ I Implementation of the code environment in accordance with good practices. ++

* Create a git repository and clone it locally

* create your project structure from the template proposal

* Create your virtual environment

# ++ II Data cleaning ++

* Download and import your data into a database engine (your choice) (d01_data)

* Select among the tables the columns which from near or far could be interesting for the study (d02_intermediate)

* Find out if there are missing values, deal with them (d02_intermediate)

* Find out if there are any columns that should be transformed into datetime (d02_intermediate)

* Check data consistency (d02_intermediate)

* Find outliers and process them (d02_intermediate)

# ++ III Data visualization (Carreer_visualization.ipynb) ++

For data workers in the United States give:

* the average salary, the median salary, and represent the ten deciles. Do the exercise for both bases and compare the results.

* The average salary according to the job title, circular diagram of the distribution of its jobtitles (base 1)

# ++ Answer questions (justifying): ++

* Is it better to work for one or more companies?

* Does the number of people in his team have an influence on your salary?

* Does the number of years of experience in this type of job have an influence on your salary?

* Is there a pay gap between men and women in data-related jobs in the United States.

* If this pay inequality exists (suspense), is it due to the fact that women are less well represented in the best paid jobs or that for identical work they are on average less well paid?

* Is there a difference between the evolution of wages linked to experience in the same job between men and women?

* Summarize in a few lines your career plan to conquer the American dream.

IV To go further (optional)

For each exercise, come to me for details on the instructions:

* Represent a "heat-map" of the United States based on average salaries

* What do you think of my HO hypothesis: "Well paid people tend to want to stay in their business."

* Is the average salary and the distribution according to the job-title consistent in the two bases.
